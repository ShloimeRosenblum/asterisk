Subject: AMI (Asterisk Manager Interface)

Previously, GetConfig and UpdateConfig were able to access files outside of
the Asterisk configuration directory. Now this access is put behind the
live_dangerously configuration option in asterisk.conf, which is disabled by
default. If access to configuration files outside of the Asterisk configuation
directory is required via AMI, then the live_dangerously configuration option
must be set to yes.
