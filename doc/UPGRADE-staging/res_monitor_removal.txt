Subject: res_monitor
Master-Only: True

This module was deprecated in Asterisk 16
and is now being removed in accordance with
the Asterisk Module Deprecation policy.

This also removes the 'w' and 'W' options
for app_queue.

MixMonitor should be default and only option
for all settings that previously used either
Monitor or MixMonitor.
