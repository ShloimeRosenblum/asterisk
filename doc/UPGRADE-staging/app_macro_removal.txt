Subject: app_macro
Master-Only: True

This module was deprecated in Asterisk 16
and is now being removed in accordance with
the Asterisk Module Deprecation policy.


For most modules that interacted with app_macro,
this change is limited to no longer looking for
the current context from the macrocontext when set.

The following modules have additional impacts:

app_dial - no longer supports M^ connected/redirecting macro

app_minivm - samples written using macro will no longer work.
The sample needs to be re-written

app_queue - can no longer call a macro on the called party's
channel.  Use gosub which is currently supported

ccss - no callback macro, gosub only

app_voicemail - no macro support

channel  - remove macrocontext and priority, no connected
line or redirection macro options

options - stdexten is deprecated to gosub as the default
and only options

pbx - removed macrolock

pbx_dundi - no longer look for macro

snmp - removed macro context, exten, and priority
